# Simultaneous drawing application challenge

*Create a socket server that connects to multiple browser clients and sends drawing data between them to create a synchronized drawing application.*

## Setup

* Clone this repository on to your local machine.

* Run `npm install` to get the Socket.io dependency.

## Specifications

* The client should accept mouse input, and draw a line when the user clicks and drags on the canvas.

* Any lines drawn by a client should be sent to the other clients and reproduced on their screens.

## Notes

* Places to write your code have been marked in `public/main.js` and `server.js`

* Be prepared to answer some follow up questions after you complete the task.

* I will be available for the entire time you are working on the task to answer any questions you have.
